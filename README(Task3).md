# UAV System Connection Guide

This repository provides a guide on how to connect the components of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) system, including the Cube Orange+ flight controller, ArduPlane/ArduCopter firmware, Here3+ GPS, RFD900 telemetry, Jetson Nano on-board computer, and a 5GHz RF link for ground control.


## Components

1. **Flight Controller (Cube Orange+)**:
   - The flight controller is the core component responsible for managing the UAV's flight operations, including stabilization, navigation, and control.
   - It needs to receive accurate GPS data from the GPS module (Here3+) to determine the UAV's position, altitude, and velocity.
   - The Cube Orange+ also communicates with the on-board computer (Jetson Nano) to receive high-level commands and send telemetry data.

2. **Firmware (ArduPlane/ArduCopter)**:
   - The firmware running on the flight controller defines the behavior and control algorithms of the UAV.
   - It interprets data from various sensors, including the GPS, to execute flight plans and maintain stability.
   
3. **GPS (Here3+)**:
   - The GPS module (Here3+) provides precise global positioning data, which is essential for accurate navigation, waypoint following, and return-to-home functionality.
   - It ensures that the UAV knows its location relative to its starting point, other waypoints, and potential obstacles.
   
4. **Telemetry RFD900**:
   - The telemetry module (RFD900) establishes a bi-directional communication link between the UAV and the ground control station.
   - It allows operators to monitor the UAV's status, receive telemetry data (e.g., battery voltage, altitude), and send commands to the UAV in real-time.
   
5. **On-board Computer (Jetson Nano)**:
   - The Jetson Nano serves as the brains of the UAV for high-level processing tasks.
   - It runs computer vision algorithms, AI models, and mission planning software.
   - The Jetson Nano communicates with the flight controller to send navigation commands, such as setting waypoints or altering flight modes, based on the processed data.
   
6. **5GHz RF**:
   - The 5GHz RF link is used for communication between the ground control station (typically a computer or tablet) and the on-board computer (Jetson Nano).
   - It provides a high-bandwidth data link for mission planning, real-time monitoring, and remote control of the on-board computer.

## Connections

1. **Flight Controller to GPS (Here3+)**:
   - The connection ensures that the flight controller receives accurate GPS data, enabling precise navigation, waypoint following, and position hold functions.
   
2. **Flight Controller to Telemetry RFD900**:
   - This connection enables real-time communication between the flight controller and the ground control station, allowing operators to monitor and control the UAV during flight.
   
3. **Telemetry RFD900 to Ground Control Station (5GHz RF)**:
   - The RFD900 module communicates with the ground control station through a long-range 5GHz RF link, providing a reliable data link between the UAV and operators on the ground.
   
4. **Flight Controller to On-board Computer (Jetson Nano)**:
   - This connection allows the on-board computer to send navigation commands and mission plans to the flight controller.
   - The flight controller sends telemetry data back to the on-board computer for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

5. **On-board Computer (Jetson Nano) for High-Level Processing**:
   - The Jetson Nano handles computationally intensive tasks such as computer vision, object detection, and mission planning.
   - It communicates with the flight controller to translate high-level objectives into low-level flight commands.
